		<h2> 
		A little bit of information about me
		</h2>
			<p class="nfont"> My name is Dmitriy Mamedov. I was born in the southern part of Kazakhstan, no it is not part of Russia, in the city called Shymkent. Shymkent is a third largest city in Kazakhstan.
		At the age of 18 I decided to go to the Tomsk State Unviersity, yes it is Russia, to study the Technological Quality managment. However, after a little while I changed my mind and started learning English in order to find a better place in the world.
		Lithuania, not a part of Russia, came as an option and I decided to give it chance. About half of a year later, I succeeded in my English studies and succesfully got enroled in studying Bussiness Administration. Last semester I noticed a genuine interest in the webdesign field, so i decided to give it a go.
		In addition to the developing Web Design skills, I work on my portfolio of proffesional Paint artist. I will include couple pictures of my happy face, so you will ever see it, in the different parts of the world that I liked.
